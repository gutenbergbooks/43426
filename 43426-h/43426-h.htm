<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Finland</span> is one of the little countries in
whose struggles for greater freedom the world
is interested to-day. It is situated on the
northeast shore of the Baltic Sea, and is
bounded by Russia, Norway and Sweden, the
Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland. A
maze of rocks and small, pine-covered islands
form a ring around the coast. The art of navigating
between these requires much skill and
long apprenticeship, so that it is no wonder that
Finland, among other things, is noted for her
pilots.</p>

<p>"Forest, rock, and water" is the way in
which one writer describes Finland. This little
country, known all over the world for its
progressive ideas, is thinly inhabited, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
only one city, the capital Helsingfors, of any
size. Over eighty-six per cent. of the people
are Finnish, twelve per cent. Swedish, and the
rest Russians, Germans, and Lapps.</p>

<p>Little is known of Finnish history before the
twelfth century, when King Eric of Sweden invaded
the land to Christianize the inhabitants.
Swedish settlements followed and Finland became
a province of Sweden. It remained that
for six hundred years, during which time there
were constant conflicts between the Russians
and Swedes for the possession of Finnish ports.</p>

<p>While Sweden was engaged with Napoleon,
the Finns, tired of the ceaseless disorder,
agreed to union with Russia on condition that
they be assured a certain independence. This
was conceded, Alexander I, then Tzar of Russia,
taking oath as Grand Duke of Finland and
promising to observe the religion of the country
and all the privileges and rights which it
had so far enjoyed. This oath was kept more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
scrupulously than by the last two Swedish monarchs,
and cordial relations were established
between Russia and Finland. The Finnish
people began to take a more prominent part in
their own affairs, for up to that time the
Swedes had had the upper hand everywhere.
Alexander boasted with some truth that he had
created a nation.</p>

<p>In 1863 Tzar Alexander II gave a Representative
Constitution to Finland.</p>

<p>In 1899, the present deposed Russian ruler,
Nicholas II, was ill-advised enough to issue a
manifesto suspending the Finnish Constitution.
Unheeded protests followed, and up to 1904
there is an unenviable record of oppression and
suppression on the part of Russia.</p>

<p>In November, 1906, however, the Tzar was
compelled to make the concessions that the
nation demanded.</p>

<p>During the present world conflict the Finns
have proclaimed in their Parliament their right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
to absolute independence, and their claim is
sanctioned by the greatest of the European
nations, which recognize the Republic of
Finland.</p>

<h2>Our Little Finnish Cousin</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A FARM HOME</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was early autumn in the Finland forest
by the lake. Gold glistened from the underbrush,
from the great beds of bracken, from the
shining birches, from the paler aspens, and even
from the prized rowans and juniper trees.</p>

<p>On one side where the forest grew thinner,
there was a glimpse of marshy land where big
whortleberries grew in profusion. Around
this marshy spot a tiny path led to a succession
of fields in some of which were grazing cattle, in
some, queer tall haystacks, and in two smaller
ones, grain still uncut.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Two children&mdash;a boy and a girl&mdash;made
their way from the forest toward the lake,
their hands tightly clasping birchen baskets
filled with berries that they had succeeded in
gathering. Reaching the shore, they silently
took their places in a small boat moored under
a clump of trees. Each seized an oar, and
began to row with experienced measured strokes
to the other side.</p>

<p>Both unsmiling faces had the same candid
capable air, but that was the only resemblance.
Ten-year-old Juhani was like his father who
belonged to the Tavastian type of Finn. He
was pale, with high cheek bones, thin hair, and
a strong chin that seemed to say: "I won't
give in! I won't give in!" He might have
been taken for sulky until you met the look of
sincere inquiry under his well-formed brows.</p>

<p>Six-year Maja was fairer. She was brown-eyed
and brown-haired, like her Karelian
mother who belonged to the other decided type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of Finn. Despite the silent gentleness of her
face, she looked as if, on occasion, she could
be high spirited and even gay.</p>

<p>A little crowd was gathered at the landing
stage to which they crossed, and more persons
came hurrying up as a blast was heard from a
steamer still some distance away on the lake.
There were other children like themselves with
baskets of birch, and women with cakes and
cookies and farm produce for sale. Some of
these were busily knitting while they waited to
offer their wares. Most prominent among all
thus gathered was a rather short, sturdy girl,
who seemed entirely indifferent to the fact that
the kerchief tied around her head was not at
all becoming. This was Hilja, who, although
only eighteen, already held the important position
of pier-master.</p>

<p>At last, amid much commotion, the steamer
came up. The passengers stepped ashore and
bought many of the good things offered. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
even when all were sold there was no sign of
the steamer's departure. The big stacks of
wood piled on the wharf, that were to serve
the steamer for fuel, had first to be carried
aboard. For this there was help in plenty.
Men, women, and children were eager to have
their services accepted. A couple of foreigners
grew restless at the delay, but no one else betrayed
any impatience, having been brought up,
no doubt, on the Finnish proverb, "God did
not create hurry."</p>

<p>The pier-master shouted something when it
was all in, and the steamer, with many toots,
departed. The people scattered until only
Juhani and Maja remained to watch a heavily
laden timber barge go slowly by on its way to
the coast. Before it passed Juhani had nudged
Maja to show her the pennies he had earned by
carrying wood. With the slightest possible
twinkle of mischief, Maja at first kept her own
fist tightly closed. "Oh, show what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
have!" Juhani exclaimed somewhat contemptuously,
at which Maja opened her hand and
showed twice as many pennies that her sweet
face, as well as the nice berries, had brought
her.</p>

<p>Juhani showed his surprise by staring and
staring until Maja closed her hand again,
explaining half in apology, "It was from
the foreigners," and led the way to their
boat.</p>

<p>Again they rowed silently over, anchored
their boat in a little cove, and then walked
rapidly across the fields. Maja began to hum
a folk song, to which Juhani soon whistled a
tune while he kept one hand on a sheathed
knife, called a <i>pukko</i>, hanging from the belt
around his waist. It was no wonder he was
conscious and proud that it hung there. When
his father had given it to him a few days before,
he had said, "You are beginning to do man's
work, Juhani, and so I think that you deserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a man's knife." Nor was it a cheap knife.
Its leather sheath was tipped with brass and
very prettily ornamented with a colored pattern.</p>

<p>Both children were barefoot and both walked
with equal unconcern over stubble and sharp
stones. At the edge of the last field Maja
glanced inquiringly at her brother and then
broke into a run. Juhani did not follow her
example at first, but, when he did, he easily
overtook her near a square farmhouse painted
a bright red, but with doors and windows outlined
in white. Against this house, reaching
from the ground to the black painted roof,
was a ladder to be used in case of fire. Up
this Juhani ran, waving his hand to his sister
when at the top.</p>

<p>Near this house were three storehouses, one
for food, one for clothes and one for implements.
Further away were cow houses, and
a stable, the loft of which was used for storing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
food in winter, and as a bedroom for the maid
servants in summer. There was also a small
pig sty built of granite, a stone of which Finland
has so much that it has been said it would
be possible to rebuild all of London with it
and still leave the supply apparently undiminished.
Neat, strong fences of slanting wood
enclosed these buildings.</p>

<p>Off by itself was an outbuilding more important
in a way than any of these, the bath-house,
which in Finland is never missing.</p>

<p>An older girl of about fourteen with a blue
kerchief on her head was drawing water from
a well near the kitchen door. As she emptied
the bucket made of a pine trunk and attached
to a long pole weighted at the end, she called
to Juhani, who had just jumped from the
ladder: "Hurry! The pastor has come to
stay till we go to church to-morrow and he
wants to ask you some Bible questions."</p>

<p>Without waiting for her, Juhani followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Maja, who had already entered the kitchen
bright with shining copper, stopping first, however,
to wipe his feet on a mat made of pine
branches laid one above another.</p>

<p>This kitchen led directly into a pleasant
living-room, with a tall china tiled stove, some
chairs, a big sofa, a table, and a carved cupboard.
Here were several odd beds too, that
did not look like beds at all. They were beds
shut up for the day. At night they would be
pulled open. A small loom stood in one corner.
Strips of home-made carpet were laid on the
yellow painted floor.</p>

<p>On one wall hung a picture which had lately
had a peculiar fascination for Maja. It represented
Katrine Mansdottir, a beautiful peasant
woman with a sad romantic history. She lived
when Finland was under Swedish rule. King
Eric the Fourteenth had been captivated by her
winsomeness when he first saw her selling fruit
on the street. He had her taken to his castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and educated her like a princess. When she
was old enough he married her, much to the
dissatisfaction of his conservative courtiers.
Later the King was deposed and cast into
prison. Here his wife showed her gratitude
for all that he had done for her, sharing his
imprisonment and ministering to him until his
death. Then she renounced her crown and
retired to live among the loyal Finns who loved
her for the friendship that she had always
shown them.</p>

<p>On the most comfortable chair in the room
sat the pastor, a man who looked so serious
that one wondered if he ever smiled. No one
who knew his duties and responsibilities could
wonder at this. Among them were visiting the
widely scattered members of his parish, comforting
them in sorrow and distress, helping
them with advice when needed. Just outside
the nearest village, on the other side of the
lake, he had a little patch of land of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
which he cultivated when he could, to help
out his slender salary.</p>

<p>The children greeted the pastor like an old
friend, and seating themselves sedately on
chairs opposite him stiffened up in anticipation
of the questions that he would ask them.</p>

<p>Around four o'clock everything in the room
became evening colored, and the mother came
in and invited all into the kitchen for dinner.
There was an abundance of simple food,&mdash;salt
fish, meat and potatoes, hard rye bread,
mead and coffee, of which latter even little
Maja drank her share.</p>

<p>The first part of the meal made one think of
a Quaker meeting, it was so very quiet; but
after the mead had been passed around and the
coffee poured, a sparkle came to the eyes of all,
and even the pastor's face took on a genial glow
as, prompted by kind inquiries, he related some
of his recent experiences.</p>

<p>"You know poor old Yrjo (George)," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
said, "who is now one of my people. Well,
he's trying to learn to read and write and having
a hard time doing it. You see, he never had a
chance earlier in life, for he used to live way up
north on the outskirts of Lapland. He is
doing all this because&mdash;well, I guess you can
guess why&mdash;. Yes, he wants to be married,
and you know how strict our law is that no pastor
shall marry men or women unless they know
how to read and write. I think he'll learn, for
he's dogged. He's already built himself a
shack on my grounds not to waste time in coming
and going. When I told him this morning
that he was making progress he was as delighted
as a child."</p>

<p>Then he told of a recent visit to a big dairy
farm, of the long low buildings with ice
chambers here and there. "It was a great
pleasure," he said, "to see how neatly everything
is kept. All the floors and walls are of
blue and white tile, and the windows of stained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
glass&mdash;a pretty sight. I can't forget the rows
of shelves with their big earthenware vessels
of rich-looking milk and cream. In one room
women dressed in white were putting up butter
for export. I agree with those who think that
dairying is going to grow in importance here.
It certainly seems to pay our farmers better
than farming."</p>

<p>"I am going to be a dairy man," said Juhani.</p>

<p>"And I am going to a University and be an
architect," piped in little Maja quite as decidedly.</p>

<p>At this the family laughed, but the pastor
remarked seriously, "It's well to make plans
early. There are many women who are succeeding
in architecture, little Maja."</p>

<p>"Yes," remarked the mother, "and Maja
has an aunt in Helsingfors who is among the
number."</p>

<p>As it was Saturday night the usual preparations
had been made for a family bath, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
kindly pastor who was not considered an outsider
was invited to share in it as a matter of
course. Every one seemed to look to this bath
as a great pleasure. After the pastor had accepted,
Juhani, with face glowing, ran at once
to show the bath whisks that he had himself
made.</p>

<p>"I made a lot of them in the summer," he
explained, "for then the leaves are soft."</p>

<p>"Go take them to the bath house and steep
them in hot water," said his father, "and see
that the maids have not forgotten to strew fresh
straw on the floor."</p>

<p>"May I not get ready first," asked Juhani.
And when his father nodded, he slipped off his
clothes and ran naked to where the bath house
stood alone not far from the lake.</p>

<p>The little structure was made of pine logs
on a foundation of moss and stones. The roof
was thatched. Over the door the farmer had
carved the Finnish proverb: "The Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and the Sauna (Bath-house) are holy places."
Within, on one side, was a stone oven, while
opposite this was a series of wooden steps to
the ceiling. These were covered with straw.</p>

<p>When Juhani entered, an old woman servant
was already there poking at the big fire. Now
and then she threw on water so that it was quite
steamy when the other members of the family
came trooping in. Juhani at once seized Maja
around the waist, all his shyness evidently left
outside, and twirled her around until she
shouted for him to stop.</p>

<p>It grew hotter and hotter in the room and
more and more steamy as the different members
climbed on the step-like platforms and beat
themselves with the birch twigs which now gave
forth a pleasant fragrance.</p>

<p>Juhani and Maja had also mounted the steps,
but every once in a while they would jump down
and try to whip each other on the back and legs.</p>

<p>When all had perspired enough, they took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
turns in sitting on a chair and letting the old
woman give each a quick massage and a wash
down with cold water. Then oh, what a race
there was for the lake, into which all plunged
with shouts of laughter! Then out again and
a race for home. Maja somehow got a big
start and came in a foot ahead of her brother
who, when he saw what she was after, almost
tumbled over her in his eagerness to win.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SUNDAY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Preparations</span> for going to church next
morning were soon made. Some things that
we should consider unusual were taken, including
a big lunch and a couple of hammocks.
Two row boats carried the party some distance
down the lake to a much larger boat, called the
Church Boat. It was already half filled.
After a short wait, other peasants arrived,
greeted their friends soberly and sat down.</p>

<p>The men had on somber-looking suits, with
big felt hats and high boots. The women's
costumes varied, although the majority had
on black shapeless jackets with a white kerchief
crossed under the chin; some, however, had on
bright bodices, embroidered aprons, and blue
or crimson kerchiefs. Most of the women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
carried their prayer-books wrapped in white
handkerchiefs. When all were seated, the
young women, as well as the young men, seized
hold of the oars and the boat left the pier.</p>

<p>It was a slow journey, stops being made at
a few places where people stood waiting. It
was rather solemn, too; there was no idle
chatter; at the minister's suggestion, however,
hymns were sung.</p>

<p>The Lutheran Church, at which the party at
last arrived, was a plain building both inside
and out. It was built entirely of timber and
had a separate bell tower. As the people
walked in, the women all took their places on
one side, the men on the other.</p>

<p>The services lasted until three in the afternoon.
Maja yawned and almost put herself
asleep counting the stitches in the woman's
jacket in front of her. But when it was all
over and the people filed out of the building,
they seemed to leave some of their somberness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
there. They gathered in groups and together
departed either for a swim in the lake or with
hammocks and lunches for a picnic in the silent
woods.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i037.jpg" width="346" height="500" alt="people having a picnic" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THINGS TASTED SO GOOD OUT OF DOORS&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Things tasted so good out of doors that
Maja and Juhani smiled much at each other, although
Juhani would always put on a particularly
serious look afterwards. Then the two
swung on one of the hammocks and also on a
huge swing near the Church. "Come on for
a ramble with us in the woods," two passing
children of their own age called to them.
"Come," said Maja, taking hold of Juhani's
hand, and away they went over the greenish
gray mosses through the rosy and pale yellow
underbrush. There were bright red cranberries
here and there with which they filled their
pockets as they discussed, not church affairs,
but wood nymphs, the kind ugly <i>tomtar</i> or
brownies, and the little gray man in the woods
who has a fiery tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Suddenly Maja stopped, looking so scared
that all followed her example. "What is it?"
asked her brother.</p>

<p>"A brownie!" Maja could hardly make
herself heard.</p>

<p>The boys laughed at her as they rushed forward
and made a big brown squirrel scamper
away into the branches of a tree.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless I'd like to believe that there
were brownies around," Juhani confessed when
the girls had come up. "Do you know that
they are so kind that on Christmas they bring
a gift to every animal that lives near?"</p>

<p>The others nodded. "I'd rather see one
than a wood nymph," one of them declared.
"I'd be afraid of her. My! but she must be
ugly from behind if she's really hollow there
as they say. She's apt to do you harm too, if
you see her from the back."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached a little one-room
hut evidently deserted, for the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
swung on only one hinge. Before they peeked
in, Juhani, with a curious look on his face,
cautioned each to say "Good Day to all here"
on entering even if they saw no one, for a
<i>Tomty</i> might be hidden in some corner.</p>

<p>It was a very old type of house. The upper
half of the walls were stained black. There
was a big fire place but no chimney, the smoke
having evidently been allowed to escape through
a hole in the roof.</p>

<p>A long thin piece of resinous wood was still
fastened to one wall. This was called a <i>pare</i>,
and when lit served instead of lamp or candle.</p>

<p>There was a small clearing around the house,
and half buried in leaves near the door was
an old-time harrow that had once been formed
from a bundle of stout fir top branches.</p>

<p>Later they paused to ask for a drink of water
at a small two-room cottage of unhewn, unpainted
wood surrounded by a little pasture but
with no garden or other sign of cultivation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
around, nothing but the vast impressive forest.
A savage-looking dog that looked as if it might
have been crossed with a fox, snarled at them
but was called away by a very old woman who
explained that she was there alone, her son
having lately gone to a timber camp. "He'll
come back with enough money," she added with
a trembling voice, "to see us through the winter,
which is going to be a hard one."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that, Granny?" asked
Juhani.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you see it for yourself," the old
woman returned rather sharply, "by the great
number of berries?"</p>

<p>"Are you not lonely here?" Maja inquired
with sympathy.</p>

<p>"Aye, lonely," repeated the woman, "but
contented too, for have I not the forest with
me day and night and is it not a part of my
very soul?"</p>

<p>A long drawn whistle here made the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
realize that the church parties were breaking
up and that they must make haste to return,
so thanking the old woman they raced back
apparently as fresh as if they had not already
had a long tramp. Where the forest was
thickest it was quite dark. "If it gets any
darker," said Maja, "we'll have to stop and
pray to the Twilight Maiden to spin for us a
thread of gold to lead us safely home."</p>

<p>"There are also others to help us," said
Juhani, and half playfully he called on all the
woodland fairy folk whose names are found
in the great Finland epic, "The Kalevala":
on <i>Mielikki</i>, hostess of the forest; <i>Tuometar</i>,
nymph of the bird cherry; <i>Katejatar</i>, nymph of
the juniper; <i>Pillajatar</i>, nymph of the mountain
ash; <i>Matka-Teppo</i>, god of the road; <i>Hongatar</i>,
ruler of the pines; <i>Sinetar</i>, that beauteous elf
who paints the flowers the blue of the sky, and
on <i>Sotka's daughter</i> who protects wild game
from harm.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE END OF AUTUMN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Maja had to stay in the house
to help while her mother and sister baked, for
they were to have a <i>talko</i>, that is, neighbors
had been invited over to help with the last of
the harvesting. "Have lots of good things to
eat," Juhani called as he followed his father
out to help in one of the fields. Here a number
of peasants were driving long poles into
the ground at regular intervals; to these they
fastened eight outstretched arms, the ends of
which were curved upwards. On these arms
hay that had been cut with sickles was carefully
arranged that it might dry.</p>

<p>While this was being done, the grain that
had been dried some time before was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
baked in an outside oven or kiln not far from
the hay barn, a big long building with a corrugated
roof.</p>

<p>This baking makes the Finnish grain in demand
for seed in other countries, for it drives
away the damp and kills all insects that might
injure the germ.</p>

<p>By evening all the work was finished, and the
merry group of peasant men and women who
had given their help trooped, singing, to the
house. A big supper awaited them and as they
sat down, the men on one side of the table, the
women on the other, all showed the splendid
appetites which the work in the fields had given
them.</p>

<p>As soon as the supper was over, the floor
was cleared, and all joined in dancing the
national dance, called the <i>jenka</i>, during which
a warmth of feeling was displayed that belied
their reputation for being stolid, and that no
stranger, who might have seen the men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
women on their way to church the day before,
would have believed possible.</p>

<p>After this the weather grew less pleasant;
the sky was often dull and overcast; cold raw
winds began to blow and there was much fog
and sleet. During this time there was a certain
flurry in the farm house, for Juhani, young
as he was, had gained his father's permission
to accompany an uncle to a lumber camp some
distance to the north.</p>

<p>At the first fall of snow they left. It was
a long drive they had, one that grew colder
after the middle of the day. The air, which
was very still, had a frostiness to it that nipped
Juhani's nose and face. But neither he nor
his uncle grumbled. The faces of both had a
peculiarly similar look of patient endurance.
It was not until toward evening that they came
to a rolling swampy country where a big body
of woodmen were already at work at the rude
shelters that were to form the camp. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
one night a batch of new men had to lie around
the camp fire, turning one side, then the other
to the heat, for there were not enough huts
yet built.</p>

<p>Juhani was put to work almost at once in
picking up chips and doing all sorts of odds
and ends, for he had only been allowed to go
on condition that he was willing to make himself
useful. Later he was regularly sent alone
twice a week through the forest to a peasant
farm for milk and eggs. The coming and
going for these took all of a day. Sometimes
the forest was dark and silent; at other times
birds called to him, and wild animals, strangely
tame, would peep out from the snow-covered
brush at him.</p>

<p>Once a merry squirrel enticed him into an
old overgrown path. He continued to follow
it even after he had lost track of the squirrel
until he came to two branches, one of which he
decided led in the direction of his destination.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>After wandering about for an hour and
finding that the trees and the brush were growing
denser and denser he grew somewhat
alarmed and tried to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>He soon found that this was impossible.
Here it occurred to him that if he could get to
the top of a tree he might have a better idea
of where he was and what to do. So dropping
his pail, he scrambled up the nearest
willow. This was not high enough to give
much of an outlook, and, getting down again,
he cast longing eyes on a tall fir with no low
branches.</p>

<p>With difficulty he dragged a small uprooted
juniper to it and placing it against the trunk,
with its help he managed to reach the lowest
branch. It was then an easy task to climb to
the top of the tree.</p>

<p>There was a very fair outlook from the top
but no sign of the farmhouse for which he
was bound. There was one thing comforting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
however. It was that at some distance away
something glittered like water.</p>

<p>With a grunt Juhani let himself down and
then stood in thought. Only for a moment did
he allow himself to do this. He was too well
aware of the shortness of the days to dally.
Drawing his <i>pukko</i> (knife) he began to hew
his way through the thick underbrush, over the
springy soil, in the direction of what he knew
must be the lake.</p>

<p>Now and then fallen tree trunks had to be
scaled. Twice his feet caught in tangled vines
and threw him. Several times he had to take
the time to climb trees to assure himself that
he was going in the right direction. And all
the time he had the consciousness that night
was descending.</p>

<p>It was already dusk when he reached the
lake where, to his great relief, he recognized the
spot by means of a big bowlder as being within
half a mile of camp.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw, however, that in a very few minutes
it would be too dark to go further. The only
thing to do was to wait until the moon rose.
So gathering together as much of the brush as
he could, he started it burning and then lay
down before it to try to get a little rest.</p>

<p>Despite the fire, which continually had to be
replenished, it was very cold and he found it
necessary to turn constantly first one side, then
the other towards the flames to be at all comfortable.</p>

<p>At last the fire went out and there was nothing
left for Juhani to do except sit with his back
to the trunk of a nearby tree and wait. When
the moon came out, it was a very stiff boy who
arose and followed stumblingly the banks of
the lake to camp.</p>

<p>Here he found a group of men with his
Uncle in the lead, getting ready to start a hunt
for him. As soon as he had stammered out
his story to his Uncle the latter shook him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
angrily by the shoulder and ordered him to bed.
"Don't you ever try anything of the kind again;
at least not while you are on an errand for
me," he called after him. And Juhani never
did.</p>

<p>The boy won the favor of a driver of one
of the short sledges on which the cut-down
trees, rough hewn with axes and with the bark
peeled off, were drawn, and he sometimes had
a ride with him to the lake where men stalked
the logs on the banks. On these trips, although
he said nothing, he hardly knew whether he
admired most how the driver guided the horses
over the difficult ground or the intelligence of
the alert little Finnish horses themselves.</p>

<p>Sometimes, instead of these trips, he had an
opportunity to watch the actual cutting down
of the trees. He would sometimes quiver in
sympathy as a tree quivered before dashing
down against the other trees, perhaps remaining
suspended a moment, then coming with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
crash to the ground and raising a flurry of
snow.</p>

<p>Once a tree was down it was ready to be
cleared of branches and then sawed into logs.</p>

<p>In the evening the spring journey of the
logs, when they would be floated down the lake
and out to sea, was often discussed. Juhani
learned how men with long hooks were stationed
at the narrow or rocky places on the
water to keep the logs from getting blocked.
This was difficult and often dangerous. Sometimes
it led to loss of life.</p>

<p>While on the lake, the logs would be collected
and chained together to form great rafts.
Several of these would be fastened behind each
other and drawn by a small tug. On these
rafts the men would build themselves little
huts on which they would live, for it is slow
work to get the logs from the forests to the
mills. Indeed it almost always takes one or
two summers at least.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes instead of these stories, the men
would sing rough songs that sounded out there
in the wilds more weird and melancholy than
they really were. Sometimes they discussed
the future of Finland. There was one fellow
among them to whom Juhani loved to listen.
He remembered long the man's reply to a particularly
pessimistic statement. "Our future
depends on ourselves. Have we not the sea?
Does it not stand for power and freedom?
Shame, I say, on those who do not see it!"</p>

<p>Things in camp went along quietly enough
until near the end of the season, when two of
the men had a fight which might have ended
seriously had they not been separated in time,
for both had drawn their <i>pukkos</i> (knives).</p>

<p>Before Juhani left for home the driver invited
him to come on a trip much further east
than they were stationed. His uncle consented.
It gave Juhani an opportunity to see the very
primitive and wasteful agricultural methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that are still practiced in Finland in out-of-the-way
places, that of burning down the forest
to fertilize the land.</p>

<p>They spent the first night with the owner of
a place on which this was done. He did his
best to entertain them well.</p>

<p>After they had had supper the family gathered
around the big rude fireplace, and while
the fire crackled and a drink of some kind was
passed around the talk drifted to the future
prospects of the country. Then the peasant
proprietor told of the time when the deposed
Tzar of Russia, Nicholas II, through the
Manifesto of February fifteenth, 1899, had
tried to deprive Finland of most of her independence.
"I heard through my young son
who had just returned from further South, that
signatures for a petition to the Tzar were being
sought. 'They shall not lack mine,' I told my
wife. It was bitterly cold even for one used
to severe months of blinding snow, but I put on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
my skis and made my way through the dense
forest in the face of a harsh wind, to the nearest
settlement Here I learned that a messenger
gathering signatures had just left. Without
stopping for food or drink, I followed the
direction he had taken through a frozen swamp
and came up with him just before nightfall.
And there, with nothing to be seen but snow
around us, I signed the paper and returned to
the settlement while he went on for another
hour to the neighboring hamlet."</p>

<p>"I know of a case to match that somewhat,"
said the driver. "After the Tzar's Manifesto,
a well-to-do farmer, who lived too far
away to go to Helsingfors, wrote a petition himself
to the Tzar, had it signed by the family,
servants and those nearest, and then forwarded
it."</p>

<p>Here the old grandmother, an intelligent
looking peasant woman, with a brown plaid
shawl tightly pinned around her neck, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the lead in the conversation, harking back to
older times when she had known Elias Lönnrot
who made the folk songs he gathered into a
whole as the great Finnish epic, the "Kalevala."
This was evidently a favorite subject
with her. "I was only a young girl," she said,
"when he came as a physician to Kajana, which
is a place of which it was then said there were
two streets, 'Along one go pigs when it's wet,
along the other the inhabitants when it's dry.'
Lönnrot was a strong fine fellow, very gentle.
People used to say he would cry if he happened
to kill a fly. He was rather careless about his
clothes. I met him one day just as he was
starting on one of his searches for folk songs.
He was dressed like a peasant, with a short
pipe in his mouth and a staff in his hand. A
small flute hung from his button-hole, while a
valise and gun were slung on his back. After
he came back we spoke of nothing for weeks except
his adventures. In one place he was taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
for a tramp and found it impossible to secure
any sort of vehicle to take him on his way. In
another village the people thought him a wizard.
They wouldn't give him any food. He
remembered that an eclipse of the sun would
take place that day. 'I'll make the sun die,'
he said, 'if you don't attend to my wants.'
The people laughed and hooted, but when the
sun actually did disappear they were badly
frightened and begged him on their knees to
make it come back and brought him all kinds of
good things to eat."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said her son reflectively,
"that Lönnrot published something else besides
the 'Kalevala.'"</p>

<p>"Indeed he did," said the grandmother
quickly, proud of her knowledge, "why, I've
taught you many a verse given in the <i>Kanteletaar</i>
(the Daughter of the Kantele). It contains
about seven hundred ancient songs and
ballads."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Juhani and the driver were somewhat surprised
at hearing all this at such a far off place.
They would have gladly continued the conversation
had it not been necessary to retire early
to be prepared for the journey to the north on
the morrow.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LAPLANDERS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A heavy</span> snow fell during the night. After
they had had breakfast, Juhani and the driver
found two <i>pulkas</i> (boat shaped sleighs) awaiting
them. To each of these there was harnessed
reindeer of a dark gray color, with huge
branching antlers. There was only one rein
for each of those in the <i>pulkas</i> to hold.</p>

<p>"Notice the reindeer's foot," Juhani's companion
bade him. "See how broad and flexible
it is. It is divided, too, and so spreads when it
touches the snow."</p>

<p>"How can I get the reindeer to stop?" asked
Juhani anxiously.</p>

<p>"Well, if you really need to stop and he refuses,"
replied the driver, "all you have to do
is to fall out."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Their host wrapped furs around them as each
took his place in one of the sleds hardly big
enough to hold even one person. Then while
his wife held the deer, the farmer showed
Juhani how to wrap the rein properly around
his wrist. This being managed, the wife let
go, and they were off.</p>

<p>The country through which they now passed
was tiresomely flat and covered with small
birch and fir trees. After they had gone some
distance it began to snow in thick cloud-like
masses and the wind began to blow the snow
about as if in violent play. Juhani did very
well considering that this was his first reindeer
ride. He managed to stay in the sled even
when the reindeer bumped it hard against the
trees. Fortunately the deep furrows in the
road helped steady the sleighs, and Juhani began
to feel proud of himself when finally the
Lapp settlement came into view. Whether it
was the sight of it or something else, Juhani did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
not know, but just then the reindeer suddenly
swerved in such a way that Juhani was pitched
out. He arose quickly and called to the reindeer
to stop, but in vain. His companion was
far ahead and so, somewhat angry and mortified,
he made his way as best he could on foot
the short distance still remaining.</p>

<p>These Lapp settlements in Northern Finland
are few in number. It is said that there are
not more than two thousand Lapps in Finland.
The Finnish word Lapp or Lappu means Land-End
folk. The Lapps use another name for
themselves; it is Samelats and for their country,
Same. Many of the Lapps are fishermen,
but there are also forest and mountain
Lapps.</p>

<p>One wonders how they could get along without
the reindeer, which furnishes them with
milk, meat, and even clothing, besides drawing
their sledges. Because of these animals the
Lapps prefer the open country where reindeer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
moss is plentiful. When it is not found, the
spruce tree serves as a substitute, and a very
extravagant one, for nearly a hundred trees are
needed yearly for one reindeer.</p>

<p>When Juhani came up, he found the whole
village surrounding his friend, who laughing,
advanced with a muscular, well-proportioned
Lapp to him. The Lapp shook his hand and
assured him gravely that no one thought the
worse of him for the mishap.</p>

<p>This Lapp was dressed in a loose reindeer
costume reaching below the knees and fitting
closely about the throat. It was adorned with
gay trimmings of blue and scarlet and yellow.
On his feet were soft, pliable skin boots.</p>

<p>He led them to the largest hut. Juhani
noticed the quarters of frozen reindeer meat
hanging from the branches of the trees near it
and also the buckets full of frozen reindeer
milk.</p>

<p>When they had entered, they seated themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
on the floor on skins and waited while
snow was brought in, placed in a kettle over the
fire, melted, and coffee made. This and food
was soon placed before them. The latter consisted
of reindeer meat, a kind of rye and barley
bread, milk and a strong oily cheese. It tasted
very good to Juhani after his cold walk. When
he had eaten enough to satisfy himself as well
as his hospitable hosts, he was shyly invited to
join in an outside game with a group of dark-skinned
children with straight silky brown hair,
broad flat faces and noses, and very round eyes
compared to their elders. These children
looked like funny little bears, wrapped as they
were in fur.</p>

<p>Two of the boys carried wooden sticks which
they drove into the snow. These were made
so that a stone could rest on the top. Each
child tried his best to see how many of these
he could knock off with snowballs in a given
time.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Juhani found himself far behind his little
friends. He was not so good a shot, and he
lacked their quickness in making the balls.
But he kept on trying.</p>

<p>In the afternoon when it grew too dark and
cold to remain longer out of doors (it was
thirty degrees below zero), two of the children
went with Juhani into the unventilated hut, and
sitting down near the fire took out their knives
and began to carve. Juhani watched the older
of the two, a boy about his own age, and soon
saw that he was making a running reindeer on
the handle of a knife. Great was his surprise
next morning to have this presented him. The
mother, in the meantime, had just laid down
some reindeer intestines that she was making
into gloves.</p>

<p>"How many reindeer have you?" Juhani
asked the Lapp boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, nearly a thousand," the latter answered
carelessly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a number of uses you put them to!
I wish you would tell me all of them."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/i065.jpg" width="367" height="500" alt="two boys listening to stories in tent by fire" />
<span class="caption">&quot;JUHANI WAS LISTENING TO THE MOST MARVELOUS TALES&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The Lapp boy smiled. "To tell all would
take me all day. I will tell you a few though.
We make butter and cheese from their milk,
eat their flesh as food, make our beds and tents,
of their skins; their tendons give us our thread
and many of our eating utensils are made out
of their antlers."</p>

<p>"It must be much trouble to milk the reindeer
every day," Juhani remarked.</p>

<p>"But we don't milk them every day," the
Lapp boy quickly put in. "Only about twice
a week. Oftener it would certainly be much
trouble."</p>

<p>Juhani wanted to know still more. "Since
the reindeer are loose, how can they find food
when the ground is covered with snow several
feet deep?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They can smell it," returned the Lapp.
"They never make a mistake. As soon as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
smell it, they scrape at the snow with their feet
and nose until they get to it."</p>

<p>After another meal all gathered still closer
to the log fire to listen to news of the outside
world. For a long time the woodman talked,
and then, growing tired, he begged the Lapp
mother to tell some stories.</p>

<p>This she did in the Finnish language, which,
like all the rest of her family, she spoke well.
Soon Juhani was listening to the most marvelous
tales, of giants as big as mountains with
one enormous eye, of ugly witches that fly about
like bats at night, and of frightful goblins that
do much harm. Then, changing her tone, she
softly told the story of the goddess, <i>Nyavvinna</i>,
the kindly daughter of the Sun, a being who
first caught and tamed the reindeer and gave
them to the Lapps for their comfort and joy.</p>

<p>"Will you tell our fortune?" asked the
woodman driver, eying her somewhat askance,
when she had stopped. She smiled good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
naturedly at him, and going to a rude cabinet
took from it a kind of drum by means of which
she foretold a pleasant return journey on the
morrow.</p>

<p>Juhani watched her with simple curiosity; his
companion, however, was plainly uneasy, and
when they were alone for a minute before lying
down to sleep, he whispered, "Awfully uncanny
folks, these Lapps are."</p>

<p>The next morning, too, despite the kindly
parting, it was plain to Juhani that he was glad
to get away. They had another exhilarating
ride behind the reindeer. It had a delightful
tang to it, a trace of wildness, to which something,
even in Juhani's stolid nature, responded.</p>

<p>When they had left their sleds at the home
of their Finnish friends the driver grew talkative
and told Juhani many stories of other
trips to Lapland, one the summer before to this
same family. He laughed when he thought of
the children. "They would have had a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
time gathering berries," he said, "had it
not been for the mosquitoes. There were so
many of these that they had to wear a sort of
mosquito net fastened around the waist.
When they tore these or objected too much,
their mother rubbed tar all over their hands
and faces. My! but they did look funny then,"
and he laughed so heartily that Juhani could not
help but join him.</p>

<p>The man had many other interesting things
to tell, for his experiences had been varied.
Among other things he explained the old system
still in use in parts of Finland of getting tar,
an important Finnish industry.</p>

<p>"Those are fine tar trees," he said, when
they had come to a clump of fir and larch.
"Nothing better. Do you know how they
work the thing? Well, the wood, after being
cut, is piled high on a big platform that slopes
from all sides to the center where there is an
opening into a vat underneath. This pile is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
covered over with a thick layer of earth and
grass and then lit from below. It smolders
for several days until the pile sinks and a flame
springs up. When the tar begins to flow it
is caught in barrels. Shafts are afterwards
attached to these barrels and they are then
drawn by horses to the nearest water and loaded
on boats for the coast.</p>

<p>"These boats are built to shoot the rapids.
There is no iron used in them, the fir planks
being bound together with wooden fibers.
They don't weigh much so that they give in to
slight shocks. Wood only three-fourths of an
inch thick separates one from the water. The
boats are about thirty by three feet, very long
and narrow, you see, yet big enough to hold
about twenty barrels, with high sides to keep
out the foam.</p>

<p>"I tell you it takes skill and nerve to steer
one of these boats. The pilots have to have a
license. Besides the pilot, the crew generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
consists of two men or a man and a woman.
I wasn't much older than you are now when I
first went in one. We started at Kajana on the
Ulea River. My! how the boat did skim along!
It seemed as free as a bird. I held my breath
most of the time. And what a shock it was
when it went plunk into the rapids which extend
many miles! I'll never forget that first ride
and the peculiar joy I felt at the danger. The
last rapids are the Pyhakoski or Sacred Rapids.
They are twelve miles long, but the trip over
them took us barely twenty minutes. Here you
can see the slope of the stream. Every second
you go faster. Now you have to avoid a
whirlpool, now a rock; sometimes both. I
thought I'd just go deaf from the roar of the
waters. When we reached smooth water again
I thought I really was deaf, the silence was so
overpowering."</p>

<p>"What causes the rapids?" asked Juhani.</p>

<p>"It's the enormous bowlders," responded his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
companion. "The rapids are mighty pretty.
I've seen our largest waterfall, too. It's in a
narrow gorge at Imatra and is sixty feet high.
How many lakes make it, do you think? They
say it is a thousand! There are always lots
of tourists gazing at it and listening to its
hissing and sputtering and roaring. When
you first hear it you think there is a storm
brewing. The spray is tossed thirty feet into
the air and looks like a mass of rainbows."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SCHOOL</div>


<p><span class="smcap">School</span> opened later that year than usual,
to last until June. There was to be a vacation
of three weeks at Christmas with an occasional
week in between, as well as on special days.</p>

<p>Two languages were studied by all the children,
Finnish and Swedish instead of Finnish
and Russian as might have been expected from
Finland's connection with Russia. The teacher
told the children that there had been a time
when all schooling was Swedish, the Finnish
tongue being considered too uncouth for culture.
"Happily," he would always add, "that
time is past. It was unjust, for eighty-six per
cent of the inhabitants are Finns. We are now
fully awake." All the children had manual
training, the girls being taught cooking, sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and darning, the boys woodwork and carpentry.
The schoolhouse was surrounded by trees, and
once a week, at least, the teacher talked of the
necessity of conserving them.</p>

<p>The teacher lived near the school in a furnished
house provided by the country people.
Around it was enough grazing land for a cow.
The people saw, too, that he always had a
sufficient supply of firewood.</p>

<p>When Maja and Juhani reached the schoolhouse
on the first day they found all the names
by which Finland is sometimes known beautifully
written on the blackboard. There were
"Strawberry Land," "The Land of a Thousand
Lakes," "The Land of a Thousand
Heroes," "The Land of a Thousand Isles,"
"Marsh Land," and "Last Born Daughter of
the Sea." "This last name our country has
earned," the master explained, "because it is
in fact still rising out of the sea. As for 'Land
of a Thousand Lakes' that should rather be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
'Land of Many Thousand Lakes.' Let all
these names merely serve to remind you," he
concluded, "of our duty to our country and our
determination not to give up that freedom to
which we feel ourselves entitled."</p>

<p>The singing of the Finnish National Hymn
followed:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Our Land, our Finnish Fatherland!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ring out dear name and sound!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No hill nor dale, nor sea-worn strand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nor lofty mountain whitely grand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There is more precious to be found</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That this&mdash;our fathers' ground."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span><br />
</div>

<p>What Juhani liked best at school that year
perhaps, was his connection with the School
Paper. Every Saturday night the higher
grades, beginning with the one in which he
now was, met at the schoolhouse to consider
original contributions to it. Both poetry and
prose were submitted, and also charades and
plays. Juhani won some praise for an article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
entitled "What We Owe to the Trees." In
this he spoke of the vast number of trees in
Finland, but particularly of the uses to which
they were put. "The birch is one of our best
friends. I may not wear birch shoes but many
peasants do. From its twigs we make brooms
and bath whisks; from its bark, baskets and
cups. Its blocks are fed to our locomotives and
steamboats, and its leaves provide food for our
cattle. In time of need, when crops fail, we
even make bread from its bark."</p>

<p>Once a month came Guest Day and the children
worked hard to do themselves and the
teacher credit, for then the fathers, mothers
and friends invited had the right to ask the
pupils questions. An entertainment was always
provided; sometimes there were tableaux,
sometimes a play. These were always followed
by refreshments.</p>

<p>This year, at the first of these nights, Juhani
was honored by having an introductory recitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from the Finnish poet Topelius. A part
of it is:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"On the world's farthest peopled strand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fate gave to us a Fatherland,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The last where man his foot has set,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Daring the North Pole's threat;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The last and wildest stretch of earth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where Europe's genius built a hearth;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The last and farthest flung outpost</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Gainst night and death and frost."</span><br />
</div>

<p>A boy, somewhat younger, followed this with
a stirring recitation about a thick-headed peasant
hero who, with a small troop, was placed
to defend a bridge. All but five of this troop
were killed and the order was given to return.
The dull peasant leader did not understand and
remained at his post alone until help came,
when he died with a bullet in his heart.</p>

<p>Then came the most effective part of the
program. A girl, a pupil in one of the higher
grades, appeared dressed in the traditional
dress of a certain portion of Finland, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of a white loose blouse and short full
embroidered skirt. There was also a bodice
and a colored fringed apron. She carried a
<i>kantele</i>, a stringed instrument whose music is
of a monotonous and rather melancholy tone.
This served as the accompaniment to two or
three folk songs, which she half sang, half recited
in a way that brought forth special
applause. Coffee and cakes, carefully prepared
by the members of the Cooking Classes, were
then served, after which games were played
and riddles given. Among the latter was
Maja's favorite: "What can't speak yet
tells the truth?" Answer.&mdash;Scales.</p>

<p>The next Guest Night was devoted entirely
to the "Kalevala," that wonderful national
epic made up of the folk songs gathered by
Elias Lönnrot. It began with a tableau in
which was seen <i>Wäinämöinen</i>, the ancient bard
of the poem, "renowned for singing and
magic"; <i>Ilmarinen</i>, the children's favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
hero, a wonderful smith; <i>Kullervo</i>, the wicked
shepherd, whose hand was against every man's;
the jolly, reckless <i>Lemminkainen</i>, and <i>Louhi</i>,
the mistress of Pohjola (the North) and her
beautiful, much sought after daughter, the
Rainbow Maiden. This was followed by the
reading of a passage describing <i>Wäinämöinen's</i>
playing,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"All the birds that fly in mid-air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fell like snow flakes from the heavens,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Flew to hear the minstrel's playing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hear the harp of <i>Wäinämöinen</i>."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Then came the description of how the eagle,
the swans, the tiny finches and the fish, and all
within hearing, were affected by the magic harp
music.</div>

<p>The curtain dropped and rolled up again to
show the meeting of <i>Wäinämöinen</i> and his envious
rival <i>Youkahainen</i>, who wishes to fight.
The tableau changed before the audience into
an act in which <i>Wäinämöinen's</i> magic singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
causes his rival to sink helplessly into quicksand,
and in which he refuses every ransom <i>Youkahainen</i>
offers, until it comes to <i>Youkahainen's</i>
beauteous sister.</p>

<p>One of the pupils now read the parts from
the "Kalevala" describing the various tasks
that the heroes were called on to perform:
the forging of the magic <i>sampo</i>, a coin, corn,
and salt mill which could grind out good fortune
for whoever had it; the capturing of the
elk of Hiisi; the bridling of the fire-breathing
horse, and others.</p>

<p>Last the teacher himself took the platform
to call the attention of the audience to the
beautiful expressions of mother love scattered
throughout. He showed how even the wise
<i>Wäinämöinen</i> thought first of his mother when
in distress:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If my mother were now breathing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She would surely truly tell me</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How I might best bear this trouble,"</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and how the mother love of the hot-headed
<i>Lemminkainen</i> rescues him from death.</div>

<p>It was not always easy for Juhani and Maja
to get to school, yet it was rarely that they or
any of the other pupils were absent. Often the
only light they had going and coming was that
thrown up by the snow. Sometimes, however,
the remarkable Northern Lights (the Aurora
Borealis) helped the sun in its labors. They
grew all the sturdier, too, for having to face
wild weather.</p>

<p>All the pupils came to school on skis, made
of long narrow pieces of wood with a leather
strip in the center through which one merely
slipped the foot, so that in falling the foot was
released. The front end was pointed and
curved upward. It does not take long to go a
good distance on skis. Juhani could go seven
miles an hour on his. There were always rows
of skis at the school door, some large, some
small, for the proper length depends on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
height of the individual. To find it one stands
with arms extended above one's head. The
skis must reach from the ground to the raised
fingertips.</p>

<p>At home one of the older children's duties
was to teach a young brother or sister how to
use skis. It was not unusual to see even three-year
old babes on them. At five years most of
them could be trusted alone. The first lesson
was one of balance. One foot was placed in
advance, the knees bent with the body forward.
This was followed by making the first
step.</p>

<p>Sometimes, during vacation days, there were
ski races, but these were forgotten when in the
latter part of November announcement was
made of a ski jumping contest to be held in the
nearest village. The age limit kept the smaller
boys from all hope of taking part, but they at
once organized a ski jumping contest of their
own. Juhani was the youngest admitted even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
here. "No, I've never tried jumping," he confessed
when asked, "but I know that I can do
it." At the first meeting of the schoolboys he
had an opportunity to show what he could do.
He advanced with something like a swagger,
made a good jump but landed in a heap instead
of on his feet. His companions, who knew that
there was something to learn, all shouted, "The
cow cannot climb a hill! The cow cannot climb
a hill!" which is an old proverb, and means
that one cannot perform a feat beyond his
ability.</p>

<p>Juhani picked himself up, shut his lips tightly
together, and tried again and again until he
could outdistance many of the boys.</p>

<p>When the day of the great contest came
everybody who could went to see the sport.
A strong little platform had been built on the
side of a hill near the town. From this the
contestants were to spring.</p>

<p>There were six competitors. One especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
seemed to have won favor beforehand, not because
he was better looking than the others, for
he was not, but probably because of the merry
good humor in his eyes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 365px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;WAVING HIS ARMS TO KEEP HIS BALANCE, JUMPED FAR
FORWARD&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The signal came to start. First came a
stalwart, serious-faced youth who jumped over
sixty feet, landed on his feet, and raced down
the hill. After him followed three others, all
of whom jumped between sixty-five and seventy-five
feet. The fifth rushed after them, jumping
seventy-nine feet, but failing to land on his
feet. Last came the popular youth. He
glanced around until he met the gaze of a little
old lady in the crowd. Then he smiled and
waved his hat to her, ran up on the platform,
doubled up his legs, which he kept close together,
and then waving his arms to keep his
balance, jumped far forward. A shout of applause
burst forth as he landed on his feet
and raced down the hill. This increased still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
more when it was learned that he had out-distanced
all the others, his jump being over
eighty feet.</p>

<p>The last day of the term at school the children
had a big Christmas tree. It was decorated
with Russian and Finnish flags and
candles and with sweets for all hanging from
its branches. There were many visitors, for on
this day prizes were to be awarded to the most
deserving pupils. No one knew for certain to
whom the chief prizes were to go, but there
were often clever guesses. In Juhani's Grade,
however, a murmur of surprise was heard when
the name of the winner was announced. An
unusually shy youth stepped forward awkwardly.
Juhani remembered him as a poor boy who
had entered that term. He remembered also
how hard at first he had found the studies, then
how he improved by degrees until he ranked
with the best.</p>

<p>The teacher, in making the presentation,
dwelt on the virtue of such perseverance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
then invited the visitors to ask him any questions
in his late studies that they desired.</p>

<p>Several were eager to do this, much to the
lad's embarrassment. But no sooner did he
begin to answer than the embarrassment vanished,
and he surprised all present by the clearness
of his replies.</p>

<p>At the conclusion the teacher said: "This
year we have for good reasons departed from
our usual custom of presenting some book to be
treasured by the winner. Instead we present
to this deserving pupil a certain amount of
money with only one stipulation, that he spend
it in things that will most help him in his future
studies."</p>

<p>"What will most help me in my future
studies," the pupil responded, after some words
of thanks, "will be the thought that my mother
is more comfortable. So I accept this gladly
if you have no objection to my giving it all at
once to her."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The applause of all present showed their
consent, and after an enquiring look at his
teacher he walked up to a poorly-dressed
woman who sat at the very rear of the room
and whose eyes filled with tears as she took the
money from his hands.</p>

<p>The younger children were not the only ones
provided with schooling. In the nearest village
to Juhani's home an adult school had been
recently established by a big association called
the Society for Popular Education. One half
of the time each day was devoted to hand work,
one half to easy conversational lessons in history,
literature, science or any other study that
appealed to the particular group gathered together.
All social classes were represented in
this school. There were sons of peasants,
servants, shop-keepers. Some of the teachers
were paid; others volunteered their services to
help make life more pleasant and useful for
their fellowmen. Among the latter was a rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
neighbor who had just finished a course in one
of the big Agriculture Schools of the country
and was looking forward to having a farm of
her own. Another teacher was plainly a university
student, for she wore the regulation
student cap, on which a golden lyre was embroidered.
Much of the social life of this community
centered about this school. The people
came not only to study and learn but also to
enjoy as a relief from hard daily work the
companionship of others.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE DECEMBER VACATION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Long</span> before the coldest weather came, everything
was made ready for a six or eight months'
winter. The double windows were surrounded
by cotton wool and gummed paper to keep out
the draughts. The open rafters of the kitchen
now served as a store room. From them hung
dried fish, smoked pork, and even several weeks'
supply of rye bread in large hard cakes with
a hole in the middle of each.</p>

<p>As soon as the December holidays came,
parties at neighboring houses followed each
other in quick succession. Sometimes these
were ski-ing parties of school children with the
teacher in charge. Sometimes the older folks
gathered, and sometimes whole families.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
There was always a dinner, and almost always
dancing and the playing of games.</p>

<p>One day Juhani's whole family went to the
home of a friend who lived fully ten miles distant.
It was only about nine in the morning
when they started in two low sleighs. The air
was crisp and so still that it did not seem to
stir, the sky intensely blue, as they hurried over
snow-covered roads, past many forests, each tree
bright in its pearly gown; past two farms whose
buildings looked strikingly red and bare against
their white background.</p>

<p>As they neared their destination, a bright-looking
boy, accompanied by a kind of wolf
hound, raced up on his skis to meet them.
"You're just in time," he shouted when sufficiently
near, "to help me make a fox trap.
An old scamp of a fox has been after our
chickens and I mean to get him."</p>

<p>"Where are you going to set the trap?"
called back Juhani eagerly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to show you," responded the
other, and as Juhani dismounted from the
sleigh, the two made their way to some distance
back of the barn. Here Juhani's friend had
everything ready. First he drove a long stake
into the ground. This stake was forked at the
end with the central prong the longest. "Feel
the edges," he said to Juhani.</p>

<p>Juhani did so and almost cut his finger. The
edges were as sharp as knives.</p>

<p>"I don't understand yet," he said, putting
his hand up to his mouth, "how that can catch
a fox."</p>

<p>"Wait," returned his friend, and running to
the barn he soon returned with bait which he
placed at the top.</p>

<p>"The old fellow will jump at that," he explained,
"and catch his paw between the prongs.
You bet it'll hold him fast, too. There are a
lot of them around," he continued as they made
their way to the house, "and we're a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
put out by them. Grandfather says, however,
that it is nothing to the time when father first
moved here. Then there were wolves and
bears. I'd like to meet a bear. Do you
remember the lines:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Otso apple of the forest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With thy honey paws so curving'?</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Grandfather says that they used to use charms
to help them when they went hunting. Do you
know what he likes to talk about better than
bear hunting? It's seal shooting; perhaps
because he did it only once. It wasn't here, of
course, but on the frozen sea. He says he lay
flat on a sled in front of which he had fastened
a white sail so that the seal would take it for
a part of the ice around. He pushed the sled
with his feet, and, when near enough, shot."</div>

<p>"That was when he was a fisherman," conjectured
Juhani.</p>

<p>His friend laughed. "Please don't use the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
past tense in regard to him. Why, he's still
a fisherman. Only last year he had a fishing
adventure that would make some people's hair
rise. You look as if you didn't believe.
Come, I'll get him to tell you about it."</p>

<p>They found the old man sitting in a sunny
workroom mending a basket. He was quite
ready to talk. "I don't belong here," he said,
"but to the east end of the gulf. You say that
you want to hear what happened last spring.
Well, a whole camp of us went out together to
fish through the ice. That's done every year.
We took tents and firewood and food and expected
to stay a long time. It was all right for
a while and we got a lot of fish. But the spring
thaw came earlier than we expected; we had
fellows watching, but they were careless, and
the first thing we knew the ice had cracked and
I and one other were carried out to sea on a
great ice floe. Our companions saw us when
we were about twelve yards away, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
couldn't do anything for they hadn't any boats.
We couldn't do anything but let the wind and
wave carry us wherever they wished. I had a
bottle of rum in my pocket and a big hunk of
hard bread. My companion had nothing but
a plug of tobacco. These three things we
divided and lived on for two days. At last we
drifted to firm ice, from which, stiff as we were,
we managed to make our way to the mainland."</p>

<p>"You don't expect to go this year, do you?"
asked Juhani.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Right after the holidays.
Why shouldn't I?" asked the old man sharply.
"I wasn't drowned, was I?"</p>

<p>Right here they were fortunately called into
the house. When they reached it, Juhani at
once noticed that it was some one's name day,
for the doors were prettily decorated with
boughs. A big meal awaited them indoors,
and here Juhani found that the decorations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
were in honor of the mother for her chair was
also wreathed. He at once went up to her and
offered his congratulations, which the other
members of his family had had a chance to do
before.</p>

<p>A long time was spent at the table. When
the meal was finished each person went up to
the host and hostess, shook hands with them
and said "Tack," thank you.</p>

<p>Juhani's friend next took him for a visit to
the farm's carpenter shop, where he showed
him the posts and gates he was making. "Are
you going to have the shoemaker come to your
place this year?" he asked. "We expect him
here next week to make us enough shoes to last
the year through. The tailor isn't coming till
January. Two weeks ago we had the harness
maker; I had to help him, and I tell you, I'm
glad the harness is mended."</p>

<p>Here he thought of something else with
which to entertain his guest. "Why, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
haven't seen my new toboggan slide. Let's go
quick."</p>

<p>They stopped at the barn to get a sled and
then had several merry rides down a short but
steep hill. This was followed by snow-balling
and fancy ski jumping until time to bid each
other good-by.</p>

<p>A few days following this pleasant visit,
Juhani, Maja and the older sister attended a
"Riddle Evening" at the home of a much
nearer neighbor. Here quite a number of
young people were gathered, each trying to
be called the Master Riddle Guesser. Whoever
couldn't answer three riddles in succession
had to play the fool. He was seated in a chair
in the middle of the room. One of the girls
handed over her embroidered apron and it was
tied around his waist. Another took off the
kerchief around her neck and it was put on his
head. Still another lent her glass beads. A
saucer was then held over a candle flame until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
soot collected and with this his face was painted.
The jolly company circled around him jeering
and then forming a procession solemnly escorted
him from the room and bade him study out the
answers that he had not been able to guess.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHRISTMAS WEEK</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> days before Christmas, the whole
farmhouse was scrubbed and cleaned, while
bread was baked and ale brewed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/i101.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="girl walking out to feed birds" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SHE CARRIED OUT A BASKET FILLED WITH CRUMBS AND GRAIN&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>On Christmas Eve little Maja scattered clean
straw on all the floors.</p>

<p>"Don't forget the birds," her older sister
cautioned her.</p>

<p>"As if I would!" responded Maja. Nodding
to Juhani, who stood by the door, she carried
out a basket filled with crumbs and grain
for the wild birds and animals. Juhani soon
followed her with a sheaf of corn, which he
placed where it would be sure to attract.</p>

<p>"You haven't forgotten, have you, Juhani,"
said Maja somewhat breathlessly as they stood
together, "that they all can speak to-night?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>Juhani nodded and was silent for a moment.
It always took him some time to get stirred
up enough to talk. Then he said slowly, "I've
put some of the food near the door, for 'tis
said that if you listen behind it at night you'll
be able to understand what they say. Don't
tell, but I'm going to listen. Wouldn't it be
hunky if I found out some secret?"</p>

<p>"Oh, then I must listen, too!" exclaimed
Maja. But her brother did not like the idea.</p>

<p>"We'd be found out sure if you did," he said.
"Better let me do it alone and I'll tell you about
it to-morrow,&mdash;before I tell any one else."</p>

<p>Maja reluctantly agreed, and the two went
indoors where they separated, each to wrap
up presents that they had made and to write
the name of the recipient together with an
appropriate verse or sentence on an attached
paper. These were placed in the front room
from which they mysteriously disappeared
while the family were having their supper of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
rice porridge and <i>lut fisk</i> (stock fish), prepared
in a way peculiar to the country.</p>

<p>After supper all seated themselves near the
big stove and were very still with their eyes
on the door. Presently a loud knock came.
"Welcome! Welcome!" every one shouted.</p>

<p>The door opened and Father Christmas
dressed as a Yule Goat entered. He carried
a basket filled with gifts, and as he took one
after another up he first read the recipient's
name, then the attached verse, some of which
were so funny that they caused much laughter.
No one was left out. The servants, who were
all present, smiled happily at having been
remembered so generously, and even the big dog
came in for his share which was a piece of meat
wrapped securely in paper.</p>

<p>When bed time came, the children prepared
to go to sleep on straw in memory of the Christ
Child. Maja looked regretfully after Juhani,
who had received permission from his mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to have the straw for him placed that night on
the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>In the morning all rose early, Maja and
Juhani running into the front room to see
"Heaven," a framework hung from the ceiling
and made up of threads and yarn and straws
and decorated with gilt stars. It was lit by a
candle and seemed very beautiful to both of
them, much to the satisfaction of the older sister,
who had followed them, and whose work it was.</p>

<p>Long before six o'clock a visit had been paid
to all the farm animals, and a supply of food
and some dainty given each. Candles were
then placed in all the windows, and putting on
their heavy coats, their caps with ear flappers,
and their heavy boots, they all piled into sleighs
and were off to church.</p>

<p>It was very dark much of the way. Indeed
it would be fortunate if the sun shone for five
or six hours before night. They did not mind
the dark, for they were not alone. From all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sides people came, either on skis or in sleighs.</p>

<p>After the service there was a race of skis
and sleighs homewards over the frozen lake
in eager anticipation of the Christmas dinner,
whose chief dish, Maja whispered to Juhani,
was to be a big ham. It was not until they
were home again that she found a chance to
corner Juhani by himself and demand eagerly:
"What did they say?"</p>

<p>Juhani looked curiously at her. "I listened
last night," he said slowly, "for a long time but
I didn't hear any animal or bird speak."
Then, seeing Maja's disappointed face, he
added quickly, "There are other things one
can do. You know Esko's grandmother.
Well, she once saw a great assembly of snakes
on a hill near Impivaare. She knows all about
snakes. She says that if you can kill an old
adder and eat him just before the first cuckoo,
ever after that you'll understand the language
of birds and know all sorts of things."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Maja shuddered. "You wouldn't do that,
would you?" she asked appealingly.</p>

<p>Juhani looked at her for a moment, and then,
unable to withstand the temptation to tease
her, said, "Why not?" and ran away.</p>

<p>Before New Year's with its special significance
came, a guest arrived from Helsingfors.
It was Juhani and Maja's aunt, a woman who
had achieved some renown in the Capital as
an architect.</p>

<p>They enjoyed her vivid descriptions of how
the snow there was daily shoveled from the
pavements, and how when you step on what
remains it screams: "A hard winter! A
hard winter!"</p>

<p>"We haven't gone in for as much ice yachting
as usual," she remarked, rather sadly, the
children thought. "The times are too unsettled."</p>

<p>"Tell us about the yachting," urged Maja,
seeing the look of interest in Juhani's face, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
knowing his slowness in asking for what he
wanted.</p>

<p>"I know nothing more thrilling," the aunt
returned, smiling, "than lying flat on your
stomach on an ice yacht in motion. The yacht
may take little leaps so that at times it seems
to you as if it were about to fly. Then you rush
madly at something and prepare yourself surely
for a smash, but just in time the yacht swerves
and you are safe to fly some more. In a
sense you do fly, for when the wind is strong
the yacht is sometimes lifted high into the air.
When it comes down you feel as if the world
were coming to an end. It would have been
fine for ice yachting this year, for we had black
ice."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Maja.</p>

<p>"I know," broke in Juhani unexpectedly.
"It is when the ice forms before snow
falls."</p>

<p>His aunt nodded. "Yes; then the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
looks like a mirror and it is much smoother than
when covered with snow."</p>

<p>"Did you come direct from Helsingfors?"
asked Lilja after a pause.</p>

<p>"No," replied the aunt. "I had to go first
to Viborg." And she described to them the
famous Saima Canal, one of the many canals
of the country which starts from there. It is
built of Finnish granite and took eleven years
to complete. "It goes," she said, "to Saima
Lake, called the lake of a thousand islands, the
most important lake of Finland. This lake is
about three hundred feet above the sea level,
so that the vessels on the canal have to be raised
by locks. There are at least twenty-eight of
these. I once saw three steamers on it and
they looked as if they were walking up stairs.
We mustn't forget that this canal is one of the
good things that we owe to the Russians. It
probably would not have been constructed but
for the interest of Tzar Nicolas I, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
whose reign it was begun. Viborg seems to
be made up of Russian soldiers, which of
course is no wonder, since it is the nearest town
to the Russian frontier."</p>

<p>She seemed inclined to say more but evidently
thought better of it for she changed the conversation.
"Some friends with whom I had
dinner at Viborg told me a story that will interest
you. It was regarding a relative that
they called Pekka (Peter) and who for a while
lived in the Castle of Olafsborg in the quaint
town of Nyslott. It happened in this way.
He came to Nyslott to attend the Musical Festival
held there in the summer. The town was
crowded and he despaired of getting a bed when
he ran across an acquaintance to whom he told
his troubles.</p>

<p>"'Unfortunately,' said the latter, 'I am a
stranger here. I don't know a person,&mdash;except
the watchman who has charge of the
Castle.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"The relative is of a somewhat romantic
turn of mind. 'Excellent!' he said. 'Just
the thing. Let's go over at once and hire a
room from the watchman.'</p>

<p>"'Do you mean,' said his acquaintance incredulously,
'that you're willing to stay in a
ruined castle&mdash;probably haunted&mdash;all night?'</p>

<p>"But the young man was stubborn, and the
two secured a boat and rowed over to the
Castle. Nyslott is built on islands but the castle
has one of its own. When they landed they
found the watchman, who, after some hesitation,
offered the stranger his own room, which
was in a separate little building put up for his
benefit.</p>

<p>"But Pekka would not have it so. 'I'd
rather you'd fix me up something in the castle
itself.' The watchman thought this a joke and
proposed that they wander through the building
to find a place that would suit.</p>

<p>"So they started. Everything looked very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ancient, for the castle dates back to 1475.
They went through queer passages where the
walls were sometimes fifteen feet thick, under
arches, up winding stairs, down again, into
cellars and dungeons and ruined chambers. At
last they came to the Hall of Knights, a long,
dimly lighted room. The walls had fallen here
to enclose partly a little space that was still
roofed over.</p>

<p>"'This shall be my lodging place,' declared
the young man. 'Are you serious?' asked the
watchman.</p>

<p>"'I certainly am,' answered Pekka, putting
some money in the watchman's hand. The
watchman thought for a while. 'I shall have
to see the authorities,' he said at last.</p>

<p>"'I'll wait here,' said Pekka, and wait he
did.</p>

<p>"When the guardian of the place returned
he was all smiles. 'All right,' he said and set
to work clearing the space. Then he brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
rugs and a big fur coat on which the man could
sleep.</p>

<p>"The weather was warm and the bed couldn't
have been very uncomfortable, for Pekka
stayed there three nights. He declared afterwards
that he dreamt wonderful dreams of the
time when three races, the Swedes, the Russians
and the Finns, struggled for the possession
of this spot. One night he awoke shouting:
'The enemy! the enemy!' and then found that
the invaders were only some of the many bats,
who thought that they had a better right than
he to this castle home."</p>

<p>Here the aunt brought forth some interesting
photographs which she had taken at Helsingfors.
One was an active scene at the open
air market when the autumn sailing fleet came
to sell winter provisions. It showed the peasant
carts and the bright stalls covered with white
awnings and blue umbrellas, the market women
in gay attire, the butchers in bright pink coats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
or blouses, and the boats laden with fruit and
vegetables, kegs of salted fish, and honey.
There was also a picture taken earlier in the
year, showing one of the principal harbors with
crafts of every shape and size. There were
enormous passenger boats, little market boats
rowed by bare-armed women, small pleasure
yachts, big timber ships with red brown
sails, and a group of white Russian war vessels.</p>

<p>She had pictures, too, in which the older
members of the family were interested, showing
two very distinct styles of architecture to be
found in Helsingfors. One was of a group
of fine modern buildings on a broad street
called the Myntgatan. They were of gray
stone, six or seven stories high, dignified and
well proportioned, with carefully selected
classical decorations. In contrast to this, she
produced photographs of other buildings of
decided Finnish individuality. These buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
showed great variety, being of rough granite
or brick, with tiled roofs, unusual balconies and
porticos, fantastic plaster decorations, such as
a group of frogs, a procession of swimming
swans, a bunch of carrots and turnips, or a savage
animal head.</p>

<p>Another group of pictures showed the types
of work done by Helsingfors women. In one
of these a number of women were cleaning the
streets, using immense brooms for the sweeping.
In one, they were washing clothes on
platforms built out into the sea. In still another,
several stood on a scaffold, plastering a
house, while three others were at work constructing
a door.</p>

<p>Of all the pictures Maja liked best a view of
the statue of Runeberg, the national poet, showing
how it was decorated with flowers and
laurels on the anniversary of his birthday.
Juhani was attracted more particularly to a
picture of a magnificent horse harnessed to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sleigh, his loins covered with a cloak coming far
down to keep out the cold.</p>

<p>The aunt presented these to the children.
"Our people are kind to their horses," she
said to Juhani; then turning to Maja: "On
Runeberg's birthday not only is his statue in
the square decorated, but all houses are lit up
to show he is remembered, while in every
restaurant people give festal dinners in his
honor."</p>

<p>Then the aunt brought forth something that
the children appreciated still more than the pictures.
It was a sort of cake, especially peculiar
to Viborg, made in the form of a lover's
knot, and it had been baked on straw, some of
which still stuck to the bottom.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SUMMER TIME</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> April the melting snow and ice showed
that spring was on the way. How dirty and
muddy it was everywhere! Instead of skis,
the children had to wade to school in well
greased boots.</p>

<p>New kinds of festivities took the place of the
old. At Easter time eggs were painted and
the family feasted on <i>memma</i>, a dish of boiled
sweetened malt, eaten with cream and sugar.</p>

<p>On the first of May big swings were erected
in the grove near the church and there the people
gathered from a considerable distance, the
children to swing and frolic, and their elders to
listen to the singing of runes, some so ancient
that the meaning was no longer plain, or to
speeches welcoming the return of spring.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's play! Let's play!" the children
shouted as if they hadn't also played in the
winter. Play they did. Sometimes it was
"Last Pair Out." In this the boys and girls
formed pairs and stood behind each other. At
a signal the last couples separated, each going
on different sides of the line and trying to unite
in front before being caught by the one who was
"It." They danced "To-day is the First of
May" in a double circle, and the "Ring Dance"
to which they sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
My love is like a strawberry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So red and sweet is she:</span><br />
And no one else may swing her round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No one else 'cept me.</span><br />
</div>

<p>There was one little girl who was quite a
leader in the games. Perhaps the reason was
the enthusiastic way in which she played. She
seemed to have two favorites: "Hide and
Seek," in which the children counted out to see
who was to be "It," and "Wolf." Both boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and girls played the latter as they did most of
the other games. Juhani was the first to be
the "Wolf," to the apparent joy of the
leader, who took particular delight in teasing
and escaping from him until he just ran her
down and caught her.</p>

<p>Maja did not play this. She had found some
children younger than herself whom she joined
in making miniature farms out of stones and
sand. The first building which she erected was
not the dwelling-house but the <i>Sauna</i> or bath-house.
Then followed the other farm buildings,
and last the cattle had stones carefully
selected for them.</p>

<p>The spring, ushered in with such hearty welcome,
went with a surprising swiftness, and summer
arrived with intense blue skies and floods
of sunshine and flowers. This was the time
of the white nights,&mdash;a happy holiday time,&mdash;when
the sun shines for more than eighteen
hours at a time and for the remainder of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
twenty-four leaves generously its reflection
behind.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/i121.jpg" width="369" height="500" alt="Girls out in wind winding yarn around stalks of rye" />
<span class="caption">&quot;WOUND COLORED YARN AROUND THE RYE STALKS&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>During this springtime weather Maja saw
that there were fresh wild flowers&mdash;pansies,
lilies of the valley, lilacs, or wild roses&mdash;daily
in the living-room. She loved the spring
particularly for these. "How I love the
flowers!" she would exclaim enthusiastically
to Juhani whenever she found a new
one.</p>

<p>Juhani would smile slowly, look thoughtfully
into the distance, and after a pause return:
"I like the spring for many things, but best
I think for the change in the forest." Maja
knew that he meant the new bits of sunshine
everywhere and the new growth of needles that
glistened so green against the background of
the dark pines, and all the new bird calls to be
heard there.</p>

<p>In June the schools closed, and for a while
nothing was talked of but the preparations for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the great midsummer festival to be held on
June twenty-fourth, John the Baptist Day.</p>

<p>There seemed no end of things to be done
to show gladness. Maja wove garlands of
flowers, while Juhani and his friends cut down
great branches of birch trees in the forest, with
which to decorate the houses. Lilja and her
girl friends were also busy. They went to the
fields and wound colored yarn around the rye
stalks, arranging them to indicate joy and
sorrow, love and hate. Before the grain was
harvested these marked stalks would be found
and the year's fortune foretold according to
which was highest.</p>

<p>Big bonfires, called <i>kokko</i>, were lit on all the
highest points, and also on rafts on the lake in
honor of the Sun. These were kept burning
for twenty-four hours, for it is considered unlucky
for them to go out sooner. Around these
the people gathered to dance, many of them
coming from a distance in farm carts trimmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
with birch and filled with hay. There was a
feast, too, of warm soup, cold salmon, and
fancy cakes. The swings must not be forgotten.
Several of them had been erected and
not merely for the children. On some, young
men and women swung together, while they
sang the beautiful melancholy songs about this
beautiful fleeting time.</p>

<p>During this season tourists invaded the
country districts, some on their way to Aavasaksa
Hill where the sun can then be seen at
midnight, shedding gray, faintly luminous rays.
Among those who came were many Russians
of the wealthy and middle classes.</p>

<p>It was not all play. There was much, very
much hard work in which the children all had
their set tasks. Juhani had to drive the cattle
through the woodlands, assist Lilja with the
milking, and help make hay. Maja had to
gather berries, of which there was a great
abundance. It is true there were compensations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
for all these tasks. If children had to
gather berries, they could also eat big bowls of
them with thick cream added, at every meal.
Some of the berries Maja gathered she sold to
passengers on the lake steamers. When she
intended doing so, she made birch baskets for
them by stripping off a foot square of bark and
bending it into the shape of a box without a
lid, then sewing the sides with twigs.</p>

<p>She had also to gather sacks full of <i>luikku</i>,
a soft white cotton flower with an odd perfume,
to be used for stuffing the family pillows.</p>

<p>Although it was vacation there was one school
task that all the children had to do or cared
to do. It was gathering, pressing, and mounting
as many as possible of the numerous wild
flowers everywhere found in the woods and
fields. The best presented at the beginning of
the school term were always put on exhibition.</p>

<p>The only disagreeable part of the warm
weather was the annoyance from mosquitoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
This made it necessary to light smoldering fires
for the protection of the cattle who seemed to
appreciate the fires, for without being driven
they would cluster around them. Twigs of
juniper were burned in the house for the same
purpose. It was not always easy to get juniper,
for it grows only in clay soil and Maja and
her friends sometimes had a long tramp after it.</p>

<p>Once, remembering the story of the Lapp
children, Juhani smeared tar all over his face
and hands and then teased Maja by threatening
to put some on her too.</p>

<p>After July, the long magic days grew shorter,
and when the days and nights were again almost
equal, the children found themselves planning
what they would do when school reopened.</p>

<p>In choosing her title, Mrs. Johnston had in mind
"The Road of the Loving Heart," that famous highway,
built by the natives of Hawaii, from their settlement
to the home of Robert Louis Stevenson, as a
memorial of their love and respect for the man who
lived and labored among them, and whose example of
a loving heart has never been forgotten. This story of
a little princess and her faithful pet bear, who finally
do discover "The Road of the Loving Heart," is a masterpiece
of sympathy and understanding and beautiful
thought.</p>
